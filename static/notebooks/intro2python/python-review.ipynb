    "\n",
    "Python is one of the most popular and rapidly developing programming languages. A clear syntax which facilitates learning and a plethora of built-in and third-party libraries made Python especially popular among academics and researchers of all kinds. Python has already been the first-choice language in Machine Learning and Data Science for a while, but as far as Social Sciences are becoming more digitally-oriented it is getting in demand by sociologists, economists, linguists, and other social researchers. This course is created for students who want to learn how to solve real-world data-related problems with Python programming environment but have no experience in programming."

    "### Fact #1\n",
    "Python was created by Guido van Rossum (https://www.zotero.org/ihun/items/itemKey/4IXGQNF9) at the end of 1980<sup>th</sup>. In December 1989, Van Rossum had been looking for a \"'hobby' programming project that would keep him occupied during the week around Christmas\" as his office was closed when he decided to write an interpreter for a \"new scripting language he had been thinking about lately: a descendant of ABC that would appeal to Unix/C hackers\".\n",

    "Guido entitled himself as Benevolent Dictator For Life, which means that he retain the final say in disputes or arguments within the community (https://www.zotero.org/ihun/items/itemKey/T6XMB6WN). He had kept this title till July 2018, when retired from this post (https://www.zotero.org/ihun/items/itemKey/2P8PMKFN), tired after the fight for [Python Enhancement Proposals #572](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0572/).\n",

    "Before creating Python, Guido was a contributor to the [ABC programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language)) ‚Äî a 10-year research project to design a programming environment for beginners. ABC introduced many ideas we now consider ‚ÄúPythonic‚Äù: generic operations on sequences, built-in tuple and mapping types, structure by indentation, strong typing without variable declarations, and more. It‚Äôs no accident that Python is so user-friendly.\n",

    "\n",
    "A very high-level programming language (VHLL) is a programming language with a very high level of abstraction, used primarily as a professional programmer productivity tool. Very high-level programming languages are usually domain-specific languages, limited to a very specific application, purpose, or type of task, and they are often scripting languages (especially extension languages), controlling a specific environment. For this reason, very high-level programming languages are often referred to as goal-oriented programming languages (https://www.zotero.org/ihun/items/itemKey).\n",
